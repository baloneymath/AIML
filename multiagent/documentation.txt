    First, I classified all the ghosts to two types, scared and brave, then compute the
maze distance from pacman to all the meaningful objects using a BFS-like (priority queue)
method. In the computation of maze distance, I consider the brave ghosts as a wall and
and can go through the scared ghosts. Moreover, a ghost is consider scared if it's scared
time is twice more than the distance from pacman's position to its position.

1. food: 
        After the maze distance of each food is computed, my heuristic add a positive score
    of the maximum value of inverse food distance and the sum of the inverse food distances,
    it means that the pacman will have a great local finding ability of near foods and better
    global view of the current food distribution of the whole maze.

2. capsule:
        Same as the concept of finding the food, I add positive scores of the maximum inverse
    distance and the sum of inverse distances, but with larger weights, so that pacman will
    tend to eat the capsule and be stronger.

3. scared ghost:
        Same as the concept of finding the food, I add positive scores of the maximum inverse
    distance and the sum of inverse distances, and with weights even bigger than the weights
    of finding capsules, so that pacman will go chasing the scared ghosts.

4. brave ghost:
        To brave ghosts, I add "negative" scores of of the maximum inverse distance and the sum
    of inverse distances, so that pacman will avoid the brave ghost, and would not likely to
    die. Also, we consider both local information and global information together.
